Their ability to generate human-like text, translate languages, and create original works of art has revolutionized various domains. However, it is essential to recognize that LLMs also have limitations, one of which is their inability to solve complex math problems.\\n\\nLLMs are trained on vast datasets of text and code, enabling them to understand and generate language with remarkable accuracy. They excel at tasks that involve manipulating words and phrases, such as generating summaries, writing stories, and translating between languages. However, their capabilities are primarily limited to language-based tasks.\\n\\nWhen it comes to solving complex math problems, LLMs lack the necessary mathematical knowledge and reasoning abilities. Mathematical problem-solving requires a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, logical deduction, and the ability to apply algorithms. LLMs, despite their impressive language skills, do not possess these mathematical foundations.\\n\\nFor example, an LLM may be able to generate a coherent sentence about a complex math problem, but it cannot provide a valid solution. It lacks the capacity to understand the mathematical concepts involved, such as calculus, algebra, or trigonometry. Additionally, LLMs cannot perform complex mathematical operations like solving equations, finding derivatives, or integrating functions.\\n\\nWhile LLMs continue to evolve, their inability to solve complex math problems remains a fundamental limitation. This limitation stems from the fact that mathematical problem-solving requires a different type of knowledge and reasoning than language processing. LLMs are designed to understand and generate language, not to solve mathematical equations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Large Language Models offer remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, including generating human-like text, translating languages, and creating original works of art. However, they are not equipped to solve complex math problems due to their lack of mathematical knowledge and reasoning abilities. This limitation highlights the specialized nature of AI systems and the need for tailored solutions for different types of tasks.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":46}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Chaining\n","\n","Shoutout to James Briggs for an amazing in-depth explanation of the Langchain Runnable and LCEL\n","\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0dUOtOIrfs"],"metadata":{"id":"8Nk6v8CLTtkr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def add_five(x: int):\n","  return x + 5\n","\n","def multiply_by_two(x: int):\n","  return x * 2\n","\n","multiply_by_two(add_five(3))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vZYi13vPTt7u","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717773990960,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":325,"user":{"displayName":"Wilfredo Aaron Sosa Ramos","userId":"09390934792605274189"}},"outputId":"f498a394-a919-42f7-8d3f-75e379c81057"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["16"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":47}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# func | other | other2 | other3\n","class CustomRunnable():\n","  def __init__(self, func):\n","    self.func = func\n","\n","  def __or__(self, other):\n","    def chained_func(*args, **kwargs):\n","      # result of previous function is input for this function\n","      return other(self.func(*args, **kwargs))\n","    return CustomRunnable(chained_func)\n","\n","  def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n","    return self.func(*args, **kwargs)"],"metadata":{"id":"SXfVV8wlTwyp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Wrap functions with CustomRunnable\n","add_five = CustomRunnable(add_five)\n","multiply_by_two = CustomRunnable(multiply_by_two)\n","\n","# Run using object approach\n","chain = add_five.__or__(multiply_by_two)\n","chain(3)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AOxZz3X-UyG5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717774272257,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Wilfredo Aaron Sosa Ramos","userId":"09390934792605274189"}},"outputId":"65292935-4d64-49af-ab7a-069a8e8e936b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["16"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chain = add_five | multiply_by_two\n","chain(6)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XRDmSDb8U4VC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717774299799,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":308,"user":{"displayName":"Wilfredo Aaron Sosa Ramos","userId":"09390934792605274189"}},"outputId":"06b7a656-8b27-4f38-b522-7fa872cfa12b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["22"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":51}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Runnables\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NpHOugyhofVF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings\n","\n","embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model=\"models/embedding-001\")\n","vector = embeddings.embed_query(\"hello, world!\")\n","vector[:5]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tNic-bF0oiXa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717779563634,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":963,"user":{"displayName":"Wilfredo Aaron Sosa Ramos","userId":"09390934792605274189"}},"outputId":"e9b2682f-fea4-47a9-b945-7a1f5f53e2c7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[0.05168594419956207,\n"," -0.030764883384108543,\n"," -0.03062233328819275,\n"," -0.02802734449505806,\n"," 0.01813092641532421]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_chroma import Chroma\n","\n","vectorstore_A = Chroma.from_texts(\n","    [\n","        \"Wilfredo's birthday is the 24th of August\",\n","        \"Wilfredo works as an AI engineer and specializes in LLMs and LLMOps\",\n","    ],\n","    embedding = embeddings\n",")\n","vectorstore_B = Chroma.from_texts(\n","    [\n","        \"Alice has a small yorkshire shitzu mix who is 3 years old\",\n","        \"Alice was born in 1996\",\n","    ],\n","    embedding = embeddings\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"iACNv3s4pBHS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallel, RunnablePassthrough\n","from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","\n","retriever_A = vectorstore_A.as_retriever()\n","retriever_B = vectorstore_B.as_retriever()\n","\n","prompt = \"\"\"\n","  Answer the question below using the context.
