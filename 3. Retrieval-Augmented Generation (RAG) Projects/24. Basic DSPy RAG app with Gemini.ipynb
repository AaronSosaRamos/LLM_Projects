His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist. Gregory\\'s use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted.', 'Gregory of Gaeta | Gregory was the Duke of Gaeta from 963 until his death. He was the second son of Docibilis II of Gaeta and his wife Orania. He succeeded his brother John II, who had left only daughters. Gregory rapidly depleted the \"publicum\" (public land) of the Duchy of Gaeta by doling it out to family members as grants. Gregory disappears from the records in 964 and was succeeded by his younger brother Marinus of Fondi over the heads of his three sons. It is possible that there was an internal power struggle between factions of the Docibilan family and that Gregory was forced out. On the other hand, perhaps he died and his sons fought a losing battle for their inheritance to Gaeta.', 'Gregory Tarchaneiotes | Gregory Tarchaneiotes (Greek: Γρηγόριος Ταρχανειώτης , Italian: \"Gregorio Tracanioto\" or \"Tracamoto\" ) was a \"protospatharius\" and the long-reigning catepan of Italy from 998 to 1006. In December 999, and again on February 2, 1002, he reinstituted and confirmed the possessions of the abbey and monks of Monte Cassino in Ascoli. In 1004, he fortified and expanded the castle of Dragonara on the Fortore. He gave it three circular towers and one square one. He also strengthened Lucera.', 'Kinnairdy Castle | Kinnairdy Castle is a tower house, having five storeys and a garret, two miles south of Aberchirder, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The alternative name is Old Kinnairdy.', 'Kinnaird Castle, Brechin | Kinnaird Castle is a 15th-century castle in Angus, Scotland. The castle has been home to the Carnegie family, the Earl of Southesk, for more than 600 years.', 'Kinnaird Head | Kinnaird Head (Scottish Gaelic: \"An Ceann Àrd\" , \"high headland\") is a headland projecting into the North Sea, within the town of Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire on the east coast of Scotland. The 16th-century Kinnaird Castle was converted in 1787 for use as the Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, the first lighthouse in Scotland to be lit by the Commissioners of Northern Lights. Kinnaird Castle and the nearby Winetower were described by W. Douglas Simpson as two of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire.
