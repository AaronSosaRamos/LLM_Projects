Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961. It is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. Overall, it is slightly faster than merge sort and heapsort for randomized data, particularly on larger distributions.\n","Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.\n","Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a \"less-than\" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. It is a comparison-based sort since elements a and b are only swapped in case their relative order has been obtained in the transitive closure of prior comparison-outcomes. Most implementations of quicksort are not stable, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.\n","Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes \n","  \n","    \n","      \n","        O\n","        (\n","        n\n","        log\n","        ⁡\n","        \n","          n\n","        \n","        )\n","      \n","    \n","    {\\displaystyle O(n\\log {n})}\n","  \n"," comparisons to sort n items.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.\n","Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:\n","\n","The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).\n","The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.\n","Although some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.\n","\n","\n","\n","Page: Divide-and-conquer algorithm\n","Summary: In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm. A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.\n","The divide-and-conquer technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for many problems, such as sorting (e.g., quicksort, merge sort), multiplying large numbers (e.g., the Karatsuba algorithm), finding the closest pair of points, syntactic analysis (e.g., top-down parsers), and computing the discrete Fourier transform (FFT).\n","Designing efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms can be difficult. As in mathematical induction, it is often necessary to generalize the problem to make it amenable to a recursive solution. The correctness of a divide-and-conquer algorithm is usually proved by mathematical induction, and its computational cost is often determined by solving recurrence
